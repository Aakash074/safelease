3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Update `.env` with your configuration:
   ```env
   # Celo Testnet Configuration
   CELO_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org
   CELO_TESTNET_CHAIN_ID=44787
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

   # Self Protocol Configuration
   SELF_IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_HUB_V2=0x68c931C9a534D37aa78094877F46fE46a49F1A51

   # Frontend Configuration
   VITE_CELO_TESTNET_RPC=https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org
   VITE_CELO_CHAIN_ID=44787
   VITE_SELF_HUB_ADDRESS=0x68c931C9a534D37aa78094877F46fE46a49F1A51
   ```

## üöÄ Deployment

### 1. Deploy Smart Contracts

```bash
# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Deploy to Celo testnet
npm run deploy
```

After deployment, update your `.env` file with the deployed contract addresses.

### 2. Configure Self Protocol

1. Visit [tools.self.xyz](https://tools.self.xyz) to create verification configurations
2. Generate config IDs for different verification types
3. Update contract configuration IDs using the contract setter functions

### 3. Set Contract Scope

1. Calculate the scope using the deployed factory address
2. Update the scope in your contracts:
   ```bash
   # Example: Update scope (replace with actual values)
   npx hardhat console --network celoTestnet
   const factory = await ethers.getContractAt("SafeLeaseFactory", "YOUR_FACTORY_ADDRESS");
   const identityContract = await ethers.getContractAt("SafeLeaseIdentityVerification", "YOUR_IDENTITY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS");
   await identityContract.setScope(YOUR_CALCULATED_SCOPE);
   ```

### 4. Start Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```
